<h2>The Motivation</h2>

<p>Across the entire world, corporations, politicians and entrepreneurs are looking to crack the code on how social media influences what people do and how they think; this Social Media theory is permanently bonded to big data analysis and can grant insight into what we think matters and has the potential to change how humans communicate our ideas. Many people watch for what is “trending” on social media platforms such as Facebook or twitter, looking at the use of a hashtag or someone or something’s name as an indicator of being a hot topic or important to us. But the search isn’t over there. To gain true understanding of anything as a whole you need to understand every part of it individually, which is where our clustering comes in.</p>
